	pig styles
	important: these should be namespaced
	example:
		let's say you are creating an app called "calculator"; you should prefix all your styles with your application's name like so
		
		.calculator img {
			border: 1px solid #000;
		}
		.calculator p {
			margin: 10px 0px;
		}
		etc...

	other notes:
	* don't use ids - there may be more than one of your apps open; use classes!
	* the toolbar element is absolutely positioned and 100% wide (and therefor 0px high);
	  any elements inside it should also be absolutely positioned
